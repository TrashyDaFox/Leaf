Make sure to make all your changes in a fork of this repository, before submitting a pull request. I recommend using Github's official app (Github Desktop) for doing git stuff if you are not familiar with the `git` command line tool.

## Packaging

If you frequently need to make leaf `.mcaddon` files (for getting testers), i have an (optional!) script to do so.

```ps1
.\package.ps1
```

REMEMBER: Configure paths in `lp.json`

## Sending changes

Once you're ready, submit a pull request and i'll take a look! ðŸ©·
