January 1, 1971

So much time has passed that the time on my computer overflowed and has gone back to 1971. I dont know the exact date, but it is fine.

I just ate car keys for the first time, and let me tell you, THEY ARE CRUNCHY

The cat with elongated legs recently got upgraded to have an elongated body too, and is now chanting about grilled cheese sandwiches at night.

What is night anyways?

Is it a fragment of the imagination?

Is this what it feels like to be gay?

Wtf did i just find
