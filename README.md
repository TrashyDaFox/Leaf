# History

2 years ago, I made Azalea Essentials. While it was a good addon, it did have **A LOT** of problems. This is another attempt at an essentials addon using things I learned from making Azalea.

# What will happen to Azalea Essentials?

Nothing. I will continue to update it along with this.

# How do I download?

For now, just use the releases tab. I will not be releasing this on MCPEDL for a while.
